# Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

Based on our results, we can determine that opening a surf and ice cream shop shop in Oahu, Hawaii would be sustainable year-round. We came to this conclusion based on the weather data of a summer (June) and winter (December) months. The average temperature for both June and December are both fairly hot with averages of 74.94 degrees and 71.04 degrees respectively. Both month's temperature averages are very close to each other and each months standard deviation are also small and close to one anothers. This proves that there is little variance in temperatures between the summer and winter seasons and historically little variance of temperature within each month as well. 

Two additional queries that we can perform to gather weather data in June and December would be 
 1. To monitor and collect data on weather conditions in Oahu, specifically precipitation levels, for June and December  
 2. Comparing both June and December's weather conditions to further determine if opening a surf and ice cream shop business in Oahu is truly sustainable year-round
